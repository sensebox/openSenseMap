This repository contains the code of the openSenseMap frontend running at [https://opensensemap.org](https://opensensemap.org). To get more information about openSenseMap and senseBox visit the before mentioned links or have a look at this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8ZeT6hzjKQ) or read the [openSenseMap](https://docs.sensebox.de/category/opensensemap/) chapter in our documentation. openSenseMap is part of the [senseBox] project.

Originally, this frontend has been built as part of the bachelor thesis of [@mpfeil](https://github.com/mpfeil) at the ifgi (Institute for Geoinformatics, WWU MÃ¼nster) and is currently maintained by [@mpfeil](https://github.com/mpfeil).

The easiest way to get up and running with your own copy is clicking the Deploy to Netlify button below. It will clone the repository into your own account, and deploy the site to Netlify. It is going to ask for `Maptiles url` and `API endpoint`. Please use the default values listed under [configuration](#Configuration) or use your own.
