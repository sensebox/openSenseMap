This repository contains the code of the openSenseMap frontend running at [https://opensensemap.org](https://opensensemap.org). To get more information about openSenseMap and senseBox visit the before mentioned links or have a look at this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8ZeT6hzjKQ) or read the [openSenseMap](https://osem.books.sensebox.de/) chapter in our [books](https://books.sensebox.de/). openSenseMap is part of the [senseBox] project.

Originally, this frontend has been built as part of the bachelor thesis of [@mpfeil](https://github.com/mpfeil) at the ifgi (Institute for Geoinformatics, WWU MÃ¼nster) and is currently maintained by [@mpfeil](https://github.com/mpfeil).
